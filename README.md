Basically this is just one of my projects, aiming at releasing in a ~couple years from now



The next-gen social app for ages 10-19 — where fun meets safety.

📌 What is this?
This is a fresh social media platform built for young users (ages 10-19) who want all the vibes of Instagram, Snapchat, and Messenger — but with actual safety, heavy customization, and no creepy adult nonsense.
Think vibrant posts, quick stories, fun chats, themed profiles, all in a cozy digital bubble.

🎯 Why does it exist?
Because existing social apps are a dumpster fire for kids & teens:

🚫 Predators & catfish accounts

🚫 Toxic content with zero moderation

🚫 Data-hungry algorithms that don’t care

We’re fixing that with:

✅ Strong moderation (AI + human fallback)

✅ Zero tolerance on grooming or explicit content

✅ Privacy-first by default — no surprise DM requests

✅ Ultra-customizable profiles & feeds that actually feel like yours

✨ Core Features
🎨 Custom Profiles: Themes, fonts, mood boards, playlists.

📸 Quick Posts & Stories: A mash of Snap & IG, but safer.

💬 Chats & Groups: Only with verified friends.

🚨 Panic & Report Buttons: Easy to block, report, or bail.

🌟 Badges & Achievements: Celebrate creativity & positive engagement.

🔒 Parental / Guardian Dashboard: Optional for younger teens.

📱 Minimal Ads, No Tracking: Your data stays yours.

🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)
Frontend: React Native (for iOS & Android), maybe Flutter as fallback.

Backend: Node.js + Express, MongoDB.

Auth: Age checks + phone / email verification.

AI Moderation: Python + ML models (for text & image flagging).

Cloud: AWS or DigitalOcean.

(Still prototyping — subject to change as we stress-test.)

🚧 Status
🚀 Just getting started.
We’re building wireframes, drafting content policies, and running early user interviews to make sure this isn’t just another abandoned social ghost town.

🙌 How to Help
Designers: Help us craft the UI / UX.

Developers: React Native / backend folks, come break things.

Parents & Teens: We want your brutally honest takes.

Investors / Grants: Let’s talk. This is zero BS, we’re mission-driven.

📝 License
Will be MIT or a variant — we want to keep it open for community contributions, but still protect minors’ privacy.
